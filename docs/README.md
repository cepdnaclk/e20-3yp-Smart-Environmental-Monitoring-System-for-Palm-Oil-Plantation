## Introduction

The agriculture sector is rapidly adopting advanced technologies to improve productivity and sustainability. Oil palm plantations, such as those managed by Watawala, face significant challenges, including environmental changes, labor inefficiencies, and resource mismanagement. To address these challenges, this project aims to develop a Smart Agriculture Monitoring System that leverages IoT sensors, GPS, and image processing technologies. This system will monitor critical parameters and provide actionable insights to optimize plantation management.
